If they grow 4x in 2026, they‘re at $100b. Thanks for helping me with the calculation, if they grow 8x they are at $200b. If they simply grow 100x that would be trillions! Fantasy numbers detached from economy. And I am not denying the growth of AI usage. As if revenue growth does not slow when reaching size limited by size of the overall economy. As if reaching 20bn from 6bn the year before is the same as getting to 100bn the next year. Or 300bn after. You can not just apply insane growth numbers like in the first two years of service. ChatGPT was launched late 2022, 2023 was the first full year with rapid coverage around the world. Since 1-2 years they are heavily trying to monetize while loads of competition entering the market. Just putting into perspective: 300bn would be microsoft level of revenues. Whole world Economy runs on microsoft office. 300b would be significantly more revenues than global giants like Oracle, SAP or IBM critical to their client base. All for a funny gadget most clients at this stage say does not provide real value. You can apply funny multipliers.

First advice: research a stock as if you worked in an investment company and the person you hate the most in the company suggested it. You want to find things to destroy his idea in front of everyone. Second advice: always let the idea marinate. Don't research a stock and buy it right away. Do your research, keep it in your watchlist, look at it again in a week or in two weeks. Research again with a fresh mind and then confirm if you wanna buy or not.",0.102,0.816,0.082,-0.3933,negative,0.631944444,GOOGL,2025-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,1,GOOGL_2025Q3,GOOGL,2249.5275

They secretly hope that AI is a fad and will go away soon so they can go back to 2022. You'll often see these same people who call the AI bubble also write ""But if AI causes everyone to lose their jobs, who's going to have money to buy stocks?"".

The main financial wins on their books are from acquiring companies for ~$20m or so and selling them for ~$26m a couple of years later. Sure that’s a great profit, but that’s super small scale as a business development company and isn’t relative to the current AI data bandwidth narrative. The current data bandwidth tech only matches current speeds and the R&amp;D spend to scale is negligible. Matching the bandwidth sounds pretty good, but no data center in operation will implement. Retooling, downtime, and I don’t even know if the tech is practical or not as it seems like there are only 1-2 pilot programs in place. Right now, POET is leasing/selling their tech to companies to build systems around and POET is claiming a new growth vertical by building their own systems. However paragraphs later they claim that they can’t compete with current customers and will only service a super niche market. So that vertical is squat. If POET was so confident in their tech, and they are making such a small amount of it currently, then they wouldn’t be worried about harming their customer base if it were to lead to greater profits. In general, the vibe is claiming substance where there is little. The good thing about the company is they have a lot of cash and their spend seems responsible. The $75m investment with an optional $65m add on from the $1bn fund shows that both the company and the investment fund has enough confidence on the potential of the tech to accept the investment and for the fund to allocated such a large portion of their portfolio.

They’ve also disclosed a production order for 800G optical engines. That’s not negligible R\&amp;D; it’s productization at the current top end. * “No one will implement / only 1–2 pilots” They have commercial programs with Luxshare, where POET’s 100G and 200G-per-lane engines are integrated into 400G and 800G modules for AI datacenter networks. The production order referenced above is further evidence of uptake. * “Vertical is squat / can’t compete with their own customers” Their strategy is to sell optical engines and light sources broadly, and only build select, niche modules that don’t compete head-on with module-maker customers. That’s a deliberate channel strategy, not a lack of confidence. * “Financials are small / only flipping assets” Recent financings changed the scale: about US$75M in growth capital followed by an oversubscribed US$150M raise, putting pro-forma cash north of US$300M. The plan is to deploy into acquisitions, R&amp;D scale-up, and light-source acceleration, i.e., building bandwidth products at scale. * “Only a couple pilots → impractical” POET’s Optical Interposer is a packaging and assembly approach that lets conventional components be integrated and scaled. That practicality is why tier-1s like Luxshare and system players like Celestial AI engaged; it drops into existing module designs and emerging AI interconnects. * Blazar, faster targets, and stacking to 3.2T and 6.4T Blazar is POET’s external light-source platform designed for co-packaged optics and chip-to-chip optical links. It decouples the lasers from the hot ASIC, improves manufacturability, and enables higher-radix, higher-bandwidth architectures. Because the Optical Interposer is lane- and wavelength-scalable, you can reach beyond 1.6T by stacking engines and wavelengths. In practice that means ganging multiple 1.6T engines or moving to higher per-lane rates to build 3.2T and eventually 6.4T class modules as the ecosystem moves to 200G-per-lane and beyond. Bottom line: POET is at parity with current hyperscale speeds and pushing into 1.6T, with disclosed production orders, tier-1 partnerships, a light-source strategy built around Blazar that points to much faster architectures, and a clear scaling path to 3.2T and 6.4T as lanes and wavelengths are aggregated. Skepticism on execution is fair, but calling it “just matching bandwidth” with no implementation doesn’t match the latest reality.",0.016,0.937,0.047,0.7464,positive,8.751111111,AVGO,2025-11-02 00:00:00+00:00,0,AVGO_2025Q3,AVGO,25.52111111

But more important thing is to be able to buy at a time like this where it is more or less fairly valued. Or if you get lucky at a cheaper valuation. And then potentially you can hold it forever.

As an investor you just have to keep track of whether a stock has run too much or whether a company is leading the game or chasing it. AVGO is leading, ORCL is chasing it. Broadcom should be back to 410 within weeks. The market is suddenly reacting as if these stocks are on fire. No, they are good companies doing their business. \----- Let's consider something else. After this 10% drop AVGO is up 100% in last 1 year. There are roughly 240 trading days in a year. If you want your stock to never fall, and still be 100% up in a year, all you need is an increment of 0.28% every trading day. Since stocks go up more than 0.28% on a good day, it will also go down a lot more on a bad day. You have to buy them at a fair valuation and at least give them 2 years to move somewhere. Honestly, even a 50% return from here in 2 years is a great return on any stock. And I can say for certain that AVGO will be 600 in 2 years.

The hidden concerns behind the AI ​​boom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1pl0hz5/avgos_earnings_exceeded_expectations_so_why_did/,2025-12-12 19:15:39+00:00,ntpp7mn,2025-12-12 21:28:10+00:00,0,"AI converting this to paragraphs for anyone that needed it: AVGO's earnings report is out, showing revenue of $18 billion, a 28% increase, and net profit of $9.7 billion, a 39% increase. Both figures represent all-time highs, with AI chips being the absolute growth engine. EPS was a high $1.95, a 37% increase, and the gross profit margin was 68%. All the data significantly exceeded market expectations. However, the stock price performance was interesting, rising initially and then falling. It dropped 5% after hours yesterday. The reason is simple: the strong earnings report had already been priced into the market. AVGO's stock has already risen 80% this year, so today's earnings report was a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" situation. While there's a logic of buying expectations, that logic isn't working here. In other words, the future performance guidance is weak. Specifically, Broadcom currently has $73 billion in backlogged orders to be delivered over the next six quarters. The company's top five customers are Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Anthropic accounts for $21 billion of the unfulfilled orders, while OpenAI only accounts for $1 billion. The remaining orders, approximately $51 billion, come from Google and other major customers, averaging only $8.5 billion per quarter. However, the company's guidance for the next quarter is already $8.2 billion, meaning there will be almost no growth in the next five quarters. The market will certainly think that the next five quarters will be mediocre, and more importantly, what happens after these orders are fulfilled? It's rumored that Google, their largest customer, has already partnered with MediaTek, and their collaboration with Marvell is also continuing. In other words, Broadcom's ASIC moat is not very high, unlike Nvidia, which makes general-purpose chips. Another problem is that Broadcom warned that the gross profit margin in Q1 of fiscal year 2026 will shrink by 1% due to AI products. Although the AI ​​business is growing rapidly, the cost of investment is high. This focus on scale rather than profit has become a key concern for the market, and it also raises concerns about whether the $73 billion in orders can be delivered on time, given the significant challenges in AI chip production and supply chain management, and the high concentration of major customers, with Anthropic alone contributing $21 billion in orders. The dependence is too high. The market demands both better-than-expected growth and guaranteed profits, but Broadcom only delivered on half of that, with the other half being completely uncertain. During the conference call, it was revealed that Google will become a key customer, while Broadcom stated that it doesn't expect significant revenue from OpenAI, a key player in the AI ​​technology chain. Following the earnings report, the stock price has already fallen by over 10%. Broadcom's AI business undoubtedly has explosive potential, but the key question the market is asking is whether they have the capacity to deliver on this surge in demand.",0.047,0.88,0.073,0.7314,positive,2.208611111,AVGO,2025-11-02 00:00:00+00:00,0,AVGO_2025Q3,AVGO,981.4694444

For years, he also would say that nobody will ever catch up to Tesla in FSD as they have too big of a driving data lead, but thats proven false as waymos are obviously sufficient. This thesis might work out if robotaxis just became legalized nationwide tomorrow, but the regulatory part of this gives every competitor plenty of time to compete here.

If investors feel they'll win on the robotaxi front (which could completely usurp the car industry in general if people can be chauffeured around in a cost-effective way), they're probably still overvalued just looking at that. If they're on the cutting edge of robotics (honestly I have no idea), then $1+ trillion may be right or even low. Just on energy, probably still overvalued. But TSLA is all of these things and probably more that I'm not thinking of. And what's important is how their avid investors who keep buying their stock up to these ridic valuations think of them, which is probably at the least like a $2+ trillion company.

You can buy the 100 shares, or even a smaller amount, against your put, when you are profitable. If the price goes back up by morning, you get to keep your gains.

It's not their cash flow, operating costs, customer retention, customer acquisition cost or anything of this sort that I have a problem with but the notion that a company that finally starts growing up to its future-oriented valuation should be pumped even higher until there's not enough people on the planet to satisfy the growth expectations. If you want to beat the market, you have to find a flaw in the way something was priced and to me the most glaring flaw is the idea that just because a company does something relatively new, it can grow forever.
